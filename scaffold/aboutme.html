            <div>________________________________</div>
            <br><br>
            <div><b>THE EARLY DAYS</b></div>
            <p>I grew up in Kansas City, Missouri, and initially aspired to be a grade school teacher, taking after my mom.
                However, as I got older, I discovered a passion for all kinds of technology. I grew up around computers and
                video games as my main hobby and with my dad working as a Data Administrator, I found that programming was a
                good match for me.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <div><b>EDUCATION</b></div>
            <p>Born and raised in Kansas City, Missouri, I attended grade school in the
                Park Hill School District and went on to graduate with honors from Park Hill
                High School in 2017. After graduating, I was accepted at Missouri State University in
                Springfield, Missouri. There, I went on to study Computer Science with special interest
                in software development. I finished my bachelors degree in Computer Science and graduated
                 with honors in May of 2021.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <div><b>WORK LIFE</b></div>   
            <p>During my high school years, I worked a few part time jobs to get experience working with other people
                and learning about customer service. I worked with Hy-Vee for 3 years and Target for 6 months before
                leaving for college. During the summers between semesters, I went on to work for Ash Grove Cement Company
                at their corporate offices in Overland Park, KS and also at the Northland artists gallery in Weston, MO. 
                Currently I am working as a Software Engineer for H&R Block.
            </p> 
            <br><br>
            <div><b>CURRENT INTERESTS</b></div>
            <p>While attending college at Missouri State, I took an interest in websites, app development, game development, and product creation.
                My main interest is creating any kind of software or product that will be useful to people and make their lives
                easier and better.
            </p>
